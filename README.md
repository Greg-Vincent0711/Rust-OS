# Operating System written in Rust

Learning complex Systems programming Concepts by following a tutorial on creating a basic Operating System in Rust. I'm already familiar with low-level concepts through C programming and somewhat familiar with the general principles of OS design through a course I took while in college, so I thought it'd be pretty cool to challenge my understanding with a new language, and a guide that gets very detailed and complex.
The entire project is available on Github already, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os). I'm using the corresponding [blog post](https://os.phil-opp.com/) to understand how everything works step by step as I develop it myself.
