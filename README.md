# Operating System written in Rust

Learning complex Systems programming Concepts by following a tutorial on creating a basic Operating System in Rust. I'm already familiar with low-level concepts through C programming and somewhat familiar with the general principles of OS design through a course I took while in college, so I thought it'd be pretty cool to challenge my understanding with a new language, and a [guide](https://os.phil-opp.com/) that gets very detailed and complex.
